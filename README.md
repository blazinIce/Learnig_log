# Learning_log
My learning Log site. Make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the topics you're learning about. Whenever you learn something new about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you've learned.
This was my first projects in web development in Django, following the book 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthews.
After deployment, I requested for my friends to use the site and give me their opinions on what to add and what to edit. I was able to integret most of their ideas into my project.
For example, deleting entries and editting topics were feautures that were not originally tackled by the course but i added them later.
I am still open to ideas and constructive critisisms. 
I am here to learn. :)
